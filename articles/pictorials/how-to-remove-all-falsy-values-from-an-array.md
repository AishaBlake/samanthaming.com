# How to Remove All Falsy Values from an Array

This is one of my favorite algorithm challenge! Because it covers a fundamental topic of JavaScript. And how that knowledge is used to solve this problem. Let's go!

- falsy values
- boolean !!
- filter

## The Challenge

Write a function that returns a shortened string with ellipsis if it's too long.

## 1. Falsy values

Falsy values is absolutely a must know for JavaScript developers. When I first started learning JS, I made the mistake of trying to memorizing what was "truthy". It always confused me. Did you know an empty array is a truthy value, that always threw me off ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Instead, just focus on learning the falsy values. And whatever is NOT on that falsy list, then it's considered truthy üëç

## 2. `!!`

Once you know the falsy values, we can call `!!` to convert a value to a Boolean. But you can also use `Boolean(value)` to do the conversion too.

## 3. `filter()`

Next, we want to remove all the falsy value from our array. In other words, we want to "filter" out the falsy values and just keep the truthy values.
